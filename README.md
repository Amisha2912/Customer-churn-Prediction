# Customer-churn-Prediction
This project aims to help businesses understand the reasons behind customer departures and take proactive steps to reduce churn rates.

# Key Objectives and Components:
Churn Analysis: The project involves analyzing customer churn data, specifically using the Telco Customer Churn dataset.<br>
Machine Learning: Utilizing machine learning techniques, including classification algorithms, to build predictive models for identifying customers at risk of leaving.<br>
Data Manipulation: Leveraging Python libraries such as pandas for efficient data manipulation and preprocessing.<br>
Data Visualization: Employing matplotlib for creating visualizations that help in understanding customer behavior and churn patterns.<br>

# Steps Involved
Importing Libraries: Begin by importing essential Python libraries to facilitate data manipulation and analysis.<br>
Loading Dataset: Load the Telco Customer Churn dataset, which serves as the foundation for our analysis.<br>
Exploratory Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the dataset, understand its structure, and identify potential patterns related to customer churn.<br>
Outliers using IQR Method: Detect and handle outliers in the data using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to ensure accurate modeling.<br>
Cleaning and Transforming Data: Clean and preprocess the data, addressing missing values, and formatting issues for further analysis.<br>
One-Hot Encoding: Perform one-hot encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical format, making them suitable for machine learning models.<br>
Rearranging Columns: Organize the dataset by rearranging columns, if necessary, to ensure the data is structured appropriately for modeling.<br>
Feature Scaling: Apply feature scaling to normalize the data, ensuring that variables are on a similar scale for accurate model training.<br>
Feature Selection: Select relevant features or attributes that have the most significant impact on predicting customer churn.
Prediction using Logistic Regression: Utilize the logistic regression algorithm to build a predictive model for customer churn based on the processed data.<br>
Prediction using Support Vector Classifier: Employ the Support Vector Classifier (SVC) algorithm to create an alternative predictive model for customer churn.<br>
Prediction using Decision Tree Classifier: Develop a predictive model using the Decision Tree Classifier to explore different modeling techniques.<br>
Prediction using KNN Classifier: Implement the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm for customer churn prediction, comparing its performance with other models.<br>
